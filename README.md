# Mayflower
is a potent vessel that guards your crypto riches from the impact of every tidal attack that comes our way.

## Our Artileries include

<li> High powered <b>Protection</b> protocol that allows you to seal up your assets in our vault, <br>
set a price limit(a value below which you don't want your assets to go) <br>
and "vanish" away on your cruize <br>
and our protocol will swap your asset, if it values equal to or below the price limit, with a stable token <br>
and have it ready for you to come back to redeem your riches.

<br>
<li> An open to all <b>marketplace</b> to allow you to buy an asset at a desired price. <br>
This protocol allows you to enter a desired price, <br> lock up USDC worth this price and <br>select an asset that you wish to buy. That's it. <br> Our protocol will execute your <b>order</b> when the asset you wish to buy is available at your desired price.

<br>

<li> <b>To sweeten the pot</b>, both our artileries are equipped with a <b>compounded interest generation protocol</b>. <br> So neither your protected assets nor your locked up USDC is idle. <br>Both protocols are constants generating a yield on the assets each hold and are supplemented to your order for you to redeem when you're back.

<br>

## Where is the code for all these protocols?
Our protection tower or as we call them as [watch dog](https://github.com/CruizeFinance/watch_dog) is a repository that contains our solidity IERC20 protocols.
